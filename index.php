          <p>Welcome to my page guys, my name is alvaro, and this is the site where i host all my fun proyects, and maybe some thoughts i might have. Books, music, rocket science - all examples of stuff that i'm interested in.
            The list goes on and on, and it even grows a bit from time to time. So don't be surprised to find new sections once in a while.
            <br>
            I was born in spain in 2003, and i am currently studying physics at the University of Seville (US).

          <p class='h2'>- Purpose:</p>
          <br>
          <p> The purpose of this webpage isn't to be pretty (i mean just look at it) or to get thousands of views. It's more of a me to myself thing. Needless to say that other people are more than welcome to read my posts
            and follow the progress i make on my proyects. Also, don't hesitate to contact me if you see any errors, or if you think you can contribute to a proyect.
          </p>
