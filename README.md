# Alvarusky
Alvarusky is my personal site, which I have uploaded to <a href= 'https://github.com/Alvarusky/html'>Github</a> for commodity.

The content of this site consists on proyects I have done along the years, and some of them will be posted as independent repositories so you can use them and modify them as well.
<a href='http://alvarusky.ddns.net/'>Alvarusky</a> was first created on March 2019, as you can see in the <a href= 'http://alvarusky.ddns.net/about'> about</a> page. To see the content you will have to register, but your email is not needed.
