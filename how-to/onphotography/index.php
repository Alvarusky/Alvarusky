          <p> If you are just starting to shoot photography, you don't need a good camera. The one on your phone 
              will be fine! The key point here is to get comfortable with it and start developing a "photographer's eye".
              Moreover, i would insist that you take a ton of photos. Seriusly, i can't stress this enough. Practice makes perfection.

              Look for places where you can take good photographs. Such as parks, lakes or urban, and learn to portray them.
              Get specialized in the things you like to photograph, though never stop innovating, giving them new perspectives.

              <br>
              <br>

              PD: when you actually get a camera it's a good practice to keep taking pictures with your phone, cause you won't always have your camera on you.

          <p class='fw-bold'> II </p>
          <p> Note: Although you should specialize in what you like to photograph, don't over-specialize nor specialize in 
            very specific stuff. 
            For instance, don't get specialized in clouds, but in skies. Play with them. Shoot a lot, and 
            try to get cool perspectives and lightnings.

            <br>

            If you specialize too much in something, ur pictures will look all too much alike, making them 
            soon repetitive and thus dull.

            <p class='fw-bold'> III </p>
            <p> Always try to shoot photography that transmits a message to the viewer or makes an impression on him.
            
            <br>

            Mine: Give them perspective.
